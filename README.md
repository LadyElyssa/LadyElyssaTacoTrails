Principles
* Markers and Trails for Permanent, Replayable content only, no achievements or collections. If you are looking for achievements and collections you can try [Lady Elyssa's Achievement & Collection Guides](https://github.com/LadyElyssa/LadyElyssaAchievementGuides).
* Aim to provide smooth trails by:
   * avoiding un-necessary combat
   * minimising terrain obstacles, like bushes, rocks or trees
   * minimising the need to adjust the camera
   * why jump when you can walk

__NOTE:__ When a Waypoint is shown on screen, it is also being copied to your clipboard. You can Press Enter to activate your xurrent chat chanel and then Press and Hold CTRL and the press V to paste it in to chat, then press Enter again to send it. You can then click on that link to show you the waypoint so you can go straight to it.
